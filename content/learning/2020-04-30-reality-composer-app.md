I never even knew this existed! Found when scrolling through the (new?) discover tab of Appleâ€™s Developer app ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958)). Would be interesting to play around with this some more and see how it plugs into Xcode.

* Create an AR object with behaviors and actions using Reality Composer ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reality-composer/id1462358802)).
* Choose an object (shapes or pre-made objects). Also can choose horizontal/vertical plane, face, or image as the subject.
* Change look, add behaviors, choose how to interact.
* Test it out in AR.
* Share via iMessage or export for Xcode.
