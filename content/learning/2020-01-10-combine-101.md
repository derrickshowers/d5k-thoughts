* "The essence of Combine is: publishers send values to subscribers."
* Publisher - creates a subscription, sent to subscriber
    * Create your own by conforming to publisher protocol (need to look into this some more)
    * Use `NSNotificationCenter` (e.g. `NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: Notification.Name("SomeNotification"))`)
    * Pass through subjects (easiest way to understand what's going on, no custom classes)
* Subscriber - uses subscription to listen for changes and/or completion `Subscribers.Completion<Never>`
* Playground: [Gist](https://gist.github.com/derrickshowers/adbd6297a7d44388e5c8d47be1a46461)
