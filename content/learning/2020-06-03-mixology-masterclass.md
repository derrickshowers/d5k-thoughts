Introduction videos for both Lynette Marrero, who was born and raised in NYC getting her start at the Flatiron Lounge. She talks about the advantages of working at a place where she’s able to collaborate with other like minded people who geek out about cocktails, but also high volume. Ryan Chetiyawardana, who goes by Mr Lyan, owns a bunch of bars in London.

Both of them talk about how making cocktails is similar to culinary - exploring flavors, mixing ingredients, and entertaining friends. For home cocktailing, ingredients are simpler - save the complicated multi-step, fermented ingredients, for when you go out.

**Bar Setup**

* Don’t need a lot of fancy ingredients, just have what you love.
* However, there are a few staples that go a long way:
    * Bitters (salt and pepper for cocktails). Specifically angastora, orange, peychaud
    * Sherry, both of them have plenty of sherry on hand
    * Vermouth: red and white (small bottles)
    * Absinth is a secret weapon (salt in cooking)
* White spirits to have on hand: juniper forward gin, good vodka (plain, blank canvas), mezcal, rum
* Dark spirits to have on hand: blended scotch (designed for mixing), single malts, maybe a cognac or slightly aged tequila
* Tools: Something stir with, mix with, strain with (even a coffee filter works for straining if you’re not at home).
