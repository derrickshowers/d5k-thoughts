* A lot of people wondering, are a disincentive to a strong economy?
* When you include sales tax, property tax, etc. high income taxes is currently ~55%. Wow!
* Most people thing its a good thing to tax the rich?
* Tax cuts really don’t work to increase GDP, shown with a chart laying GDP over tax increases/decreases. This “rumor” started in the 70s with Regan, and did seem to show something, but if you continue to look again today that seems to just be coincidence.
* 2017 tax cuts were aimed at corporations and the rich, which most voters did not want.
    * Republicans wanted it not because it’s what voters wanted, it’s what donors wanted.
    * It was rushed through because congress was afraid people would ask questions about how shitty it is
    * “Not one of America’s finest moments”
* Bottom line, taxes _aren’t_ a big deal in the context of economic policy, people shouldn’t worry about them so much!
