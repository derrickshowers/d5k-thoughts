Today I want to learn a bit more about finger foods, specifically how to know if something is a choking hazard. There are a bunch of lists out there with things like raw carrots, grapes, etc., but I'm on a mission to understand what exactly makes something a choking hazard and _why_. This all stems from a [recent episode](https://castro.fm/episode/O9HX9F) of a podcast I started listening to where the hosts interview Rachel Ray about how she was brought up around food. She talks a lot about how her parents had her in the kitchen and always let her try whatever they were eating. I want this for Sophie without the fear of her choking on it!

* "The list" from Baby 411: Raw carrots, celery, popcorn, potato chips, nuts, hard candy, hard meat, fruits with seeds, raisins, hotdogs, and grapes (unless cut lengthwise). Wait on these until child is really good at chewing (2-3 years old).
* There's a [bigger list](https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/infantandtoddlernutrition/foods-and-drinks/choking-hazards.html) from the CDC.
* Let's see what the r/daddit community [has to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/fr9x44/finger_foods_and_choking/) (also cross posted in r/babyledweaning).
    * [Great article](https://www.lucieslist.com/postpartum-week-30-real-choking-hazards/) shared about biggest choking hazards and why.
* From page 96 (of this resource): Some foods are particularly risky for babies and children because of their shape. Nuts are the most well-known example--whole nuts (or large pieces) should be avoided until your child is at least three years old because they can easily get lodged in a small childâ€™s windpipe. Fruits such as cherries should have the pits removed before they are offered to your baby and it is also a good idea to cut small round fruits, such as grapes and cherry tomatoes, in half lengthwise. Remember to take care with cakes, casseroles, and salads that may contain small, hard pieces of food. Bony fish is best avoided, too, and gristle should be removed from meat.

I guess to be continued...
