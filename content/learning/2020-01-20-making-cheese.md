* Gallon of milk, cannot be ultra pasteurized, raw is best
* Citric acid lowers the PH level of the milk (~6.5) to a level where coagulation can occur.
* Coagulation happens when adding rennet (comes from the stomach of mammals). This process is similar to applying heat to eggs to turn them from liquid to solid.
* Cheese curds form, byproduct is whey (high in lactose!). Can be used for cooking.
