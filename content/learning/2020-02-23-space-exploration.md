* Capsules
    * First design, predates shuttle program.
    * Flat bottom for reentry, distributes heat across a large surface.
    * Bottom material burns off during reentry.
    * Balloon deployed to land in ocean (rafts deployed to keep it afloat until rescue arrives)
    * Gemini was the first capsule.
    * Apollo was used to travel to the moon. Moon lander attached to front.
* Shuttle
    * Developed as a way to reuse the same vehicle for multiple missions.
    * Reentry occurs by pointing the nose up and use the bottom as a large surface to distribute heat (unlike in a capsule, material does not burn off).
    * Glides to landing, only once chance to land!
    * Landing is extremely fast compared to an airplane, about 300MPH (compared to ~150MPH for an airplane)
    * Wings are only for gliding/landing, useless for launch, space travel, reentry - trend seems to be moving back toward capsules.
    * Shuttle is great for taking things to space and bringing them back, but do we want that? Is it better to have separate vehicles for cargo and human transport like we do for other things (cars vs trucks).
* Buran was the Russian take on the shuttle, but never flew to space and maybe never will now that we're moving more toward capsules again.
