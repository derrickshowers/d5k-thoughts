* Multiple Mission Controls around the world (Montreal, Munich, Tokyo, Moscow, Houston).
* Russian Mission Control communicates in waves. 
    * Originally because only able to talk to astronauts when they flew over Russia – didn’t have the means to spread out around the world (US put people in Australia, Spain to talk to astronauts while they traveled over that part of the world).
    * Now relays exist so Moscow can communicate the entire time, but choose to group communication into segments to give their astronauts peace and quiet.
* CAPCOM (originated from “capsule communicator”)
    * Responsible for taking everything in the room and communicate it in a way the crew can understand.
    * Trusted person, fellow astronaut, almost like another crew member.
* Quindar tones
    * Noise artifact that became a way to recognize when crew was talking.
    * Went away with new (digital) technology, but brought it back as an artificial sound (everyone was used to it!)

Also: Training and Learning: One-Pagers

* Chris creates one-pagers for everything from control panels to instruments with notes of 1% of everything he knows about something.
* Example he uses is an illustration of a pistol grip (something used during spacewalks). Diagram of instrument with a bunch of notes he can refer to the night before he goes on the spacewalk.
* Can be used for anything! Learn how to play a guitar, ride a motorcycle (what you read online, what an instructor said)
* Might be interesting to try with something...
