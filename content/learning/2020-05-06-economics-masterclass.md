Wow, lots of stuff here to digest. Here’s what I got from it. 

* Macroeconomics is stuff that deals with the whole economy.
* The Fed monitors and supports economic health by depositing money into banks in the form of treasury bills. Where does this money come from? Pretty much out of thin air.
* A lot of influence from the Fed is with mortgage rates (buying and selling treasury bills to raise/lower interest rates).
* The Fed is independent from government so they can move quickly (not waiting for legislation to pass) and so the white house can not use for re-election.
* IS-LM curve
    * IS - Investment/Savings
    * LM - Liquidity/Money
    * Two lines that meet in the center, the equilibrium. I think it’s a balance of a bunch of things like the amount of money and interest rates. Higher interest rates/less money in circulation vs lower interest rates and more money in circulation.
    * There is a lower bound, though - 0%. This is where the Fed can no longer support the economy.
* Interesting anecdote: most hate mail Paul receives is when he talks about the amount of money in circulation and how it is a useful fiction controlled by the government. 
    * People want it to be worth something and not some sort of fictional piece of paper (my words)
