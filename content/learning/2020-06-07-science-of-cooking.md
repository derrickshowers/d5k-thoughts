Read a few pages on meat (pages 30-43).

* What to look for in meat?
    * Yellow hue suggests grass-fed
    * Sticky or slimy surface could suggest bacteria
    * Mild but not unpleasant smell
* Vacuum packed meat right after slaughter can be dark brown (not red) until it is introduce to oxygen (turns it red)
* The color of meat is related to the levels of red-colored oxygen-supplying protein, myoglobin, in an animal’s muscles.
    * Dark “slow-twitch” muscles (chicken leg) are for endurance and need a steady supply of oxygen, meaning more myoglobin.
    * Whiter “fast-twitch” muscles (chicken breast) are for shorts bursts like flapping wings.
* Grass-fed cows store their fat just under the skin, while grain-fed cow meat tends to be well-marbled throughout.
* Broiler chickens are the name for hybrid species reared for meat production.
* Chicken classifications
    1. Indoor-farmed (most common). No exercise, meaning meat is tender, but paler and less flavor.
    2. Free-range. Some exercise, more protein, higher stress.
    3. Organic (least common). Outdoor and indoor access, not treated with antibiotics. Firmer, more flavorful meat higher in omega-3 fats.
* Pumping chicken and wet-curing bacon is the process of adding water to “improve the quality of the meat” but also conveniently increases weight for sale (sort of like brining). 37% of poultry can be water, 25% of bacon.
