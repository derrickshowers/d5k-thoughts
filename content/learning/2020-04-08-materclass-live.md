**Introduction**

Seems like most of this is from his Masterclass. Talked about a few general topics.

* Three kinds of truths
    1. Objective truth 
        * “that which has been established by virtue of large bodies of experiment and observations”
        * True! Whether or not you believe it
    2. Personal truths
        * Feelings
        * Religion
        * What you believe to be true
    3. Political truth
        * What you believe to be true simply because it’s been repeated so many times
        * Brainwashing
* Bias can cloud truths. Talked a bunch about bias.
* Effective communication is about knowing your audience. Just having an idea about something is not enough, you need to be able to communicate it.
    * When he goes on a talk show he studies the host and the audience before he goes on to know how he can be relatable.
    * What a compliment when he hears “you’re such a natural” - everything is planned.
    * Write down an idea before you say it, then you have time to think about it before you say it.
    * Look for cues from person you’re talking to and make mental notes.

**Questions**

I **bolded** the most interesting ones.

* Is it ok to believe something not backed by science?
    * Ask questions, be curious. Imposters will walk away.
* **What is the question you think about the most?**
    * Chimp and human DNA is only 2% different.
    * What if another life with completely different DNA is _slightly_ smarter. Now we’re the chimp looking at another species. Are they even interested in us? Do we even know what we’re looking for?
    * How defined us as intelligent? We did. Do we have significant intelligence to figure out how the universe works?
    * Are we smart enough to even know what questions to ask?
* What is the most valuable thing that exists on earth? Love, knowledge, or fame and fortune?
* Curiosity. Kids have it naturally, but schools but a standard way of thinking on the youth? How can parents influence in a positive way and continue to embrace curiosity?
* What links exist between human consciousness and the universe?
    * When you go to a bookstore, you see shelves and shelves of books written on consciousness. The more books you see about something, the less we know about it.
* How to stop the spread of misinformation on the internet?
    * Use Academic websites (.edu)
    * Government agencies have top people working for them (CDC, NASA, Dept of Energy, National Institute for Health)
* Can you sure your journey in becoming an astrophysicist?
    * “The sky is not the limit” - book written to explain his journey
* What is inspiring you during this challenging time?
    * Isaac Newton
* **What would humanity’s greatest accomplishment be?**
    * Turn the solar system into our backyard, be a multi-planet species.
    * Take away fighting over limited resources
* Are all planets spherical?
    * Laws of physics conspire to make things round in this universe.
    * Why is something not round? There’s a reason.
