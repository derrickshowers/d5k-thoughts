* Astronauts need to be about to withstand temps of 120ºF in the sun and -100ºF in the shade.
* Suit has everything you need, more like a 1 person spaceship. Including:
    * Oxygen purification system
    * Cooling system
    * Battery
    * Radio
* Pressure is a third of normal on earth so the suit is still bendable (~14.3psi).
* When reentering shuttle or space station, suit needs to be cleaned to rid any chemicals from outside. For example, moon sand is like broken glass because of the lack of erosion. Eventually might need to have a suit that just stays outside.
* Current version of the spacesuit is like an inflatable bag, not all that advanced. Future versions could be based on exoskeletons.
