So far, best two videos of the entire course. Lots of his own personal thoughts on inequality - how its history, how it grew, and why it’s bad for society. He feels that it’s largely cultural, not economic (supply and demand) stemming from a bunch of things (listed in notes below). It seems like he feels a lot of it is/was caused by government policy (starting with when Regan took office). He explains that he sees inequality as something we should fix for two reasons: 1. it’s morally the right thing to do; and 2. having children who can eat leads to a more productive adulthood, and therefore a more productive society. Some more notes below.

* Currently, top 10% is 50% of total income. Right after WWII this number was down to 35%.
* We claim we’re a middle class society, but we’re not (maybe during WWII we were).
* Income vs wealth
    * Income - what you earn
    * Wealth - assets
    * 19th century, people with high income had high wealth, this then shifted to income without wealth (CEOs, financial wheelers and dealers), but now shifting back (CEOs making large amounts of their income from stock options).
* Inequality starts when income from wealth/assets grow faster than the economy (this didn’t happen as much after WWII because of heavy taxes on assets).
* After the ‘08 financial crisis, hope was inequality would decrease, but it actually _increased_ as the stock market recovered but things like housing did not (main asset for middle class people is their house, only 50% of people own stock).
* Why has inequality grown so much over the past couple of years?
    * Technology decreased number of blue color jobs
    * Globalization (jobs lost to China)
    * Timing (election of Ronald Regan)
    * Political (move to _equality_ was political, why would move to _inequality_ not be?)
* Inequality drives us apart, party polarization measurement follows income distribution graph almost exactly (when top 10% of total income is at 50% party polarization is at its highest).
* Two ways to solve inequality through policy:
    * Redistribution - collecting taxes from rich and giving it to the poor.
    * Predistribution - encourage income equality by improving health care and stregthening unions without resorting to direct government intervention via taxes (e.g. increase minimum wages, strengthen unions)
