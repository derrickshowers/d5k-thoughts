* Meat basics (pp 70-71) go over storage, inspections, kosher preparation, and offal (edible by-products like liver, kidney, heart, etc.). Highlights:
    * Inspection of meat is mandatory after the slaughter and then after butchering, but quality grading is not (e.g. prime, choice)
    * Most butchering is done in packing plants and shipped as primal cuts.
* Beef basics
    * Eight grades of beef are (in order) Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter, and Canner (Prime is usually reserved for restaurants and butcher shops)
    * Most beef is steers (castrated males) or heifers (female cows). Older the animal, tougher the meat.
    * Also Kobe from Japan, Limousin from France, Angus from America.
    * See pp 72-75 for a picture of all beef cuts.
    * Summary, from back of animal to front: round, loin (flank below in belly area), rib, chuck (brisket below in belly area)
    * Porterhouse is a slice of the short loin, and then filet part of the porterhouse (or tenderloin)
    * See p 77 for an illustration of the animal.
