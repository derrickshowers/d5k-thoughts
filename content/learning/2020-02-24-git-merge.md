* A commit is created by replaying all changes since the current branch diverged from master - simple as that! Also called a 3-way merge.
* Merge commit has more than 1 parent (this is how it is shown in graph view as a merge commit).
* If the branch being merged onto has no commits past when the branches diverged, a fast forward merge is default.
* Fast forward (`--ff`) just means a commit is not made, the pointer for the branch is updated to most current.
* Fast forward is how `git pull` works. It fetches the remote and updates the pointer.
