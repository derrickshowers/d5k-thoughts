Read a few pages on sausage (pages 493-505).

* Originally a means of preservation (like duck confit, fruit james, beef jerky) and ensures no part of the animal was wasted.
* Four steps to make sausage
    1. Salt and season
    2. Rest 12-24 hours (prevent weight loss after cooking)
    3. Grind
    4. Blend
* Real joy of sausage is how customizable they are in nature - put whatever you want in them.
* All that’s required: meat, fat, salt
* **Salt is the key ingredient** to make it snappy and springy instead of mealy and mushy
    * 1-2% of the total weight
    * Sausage will not work without salt, it will just fall apart
    * Salt is what keeps moisture in (same concept as brining)
* Stuffing sausages is not necessary - adds texture and snap
* Curing
    * France = “charcuterie”; Italy = “salumi”
    * 3 types (can be combined or separate):
        1. Chemical - salt, sugar, nitrates, or nitrites added to create an environment inhospitable to bacterial growth.
        2. Smoking - wood fire nitrogen dioxide is formed, which reacts with water on the meat to form nitric acid, inhibits the growth of bacteria.
        3. Dehydration/fermentation - bacterial need water to surveve
    * Adding salt to sausage and storing overnight is a form of curing.
