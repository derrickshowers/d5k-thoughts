Ran across these videos the other day. Apple taking the "Today at Apple" sessions they normally do in store and publishing some videos online. All 3 of these are very basic, but fun to watch, and super short (~10 minutes for all 3). The production quality was of course high (wonder what video editing software they're using?). People encouraged to post creations with [#todayatapple](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/todayatapple/) hashtag.

* You can tap with the pencil to enable markup mode.
* She can draw a lot better than me... balloons got fancy quick.

**Capture striking photography with iPhone**

* Very very basic architecture photography.
* Find different angles in your Apple-looking house.
* Tap and hold to lock focus (didn't know this!).

**Shoot photos full of personality with iPhone**

* Skip this one out of the 3, just a video on how to use portrait mode.
* Tap to focus on apple watch for portraits (didn't know this either!)
