Final video of the masterclass. Not a lot of substance in this video, but nice recap of the class and he discusses what he wanted to get across by doing this Masterclass: help us understand the importance of exploration to the success of the human race. Also touched on the fact that only 550 people have flown in space (out of something like 100 billion people who have ever lived), but it takes so many more to make it all happen.

My turn for a recap. Overall, interesting class. Lots different from the cooking classes I watched previously. There was a lot of talk about his personal experience in space, which was really cool to hear. There were also a few lessons on more tactile stuff (science-y equations and such). Reflecting back on the class, I learned just how _much_ an astronaut has to know about basically _everything_. I want to try the recommendation on putting together a one-pager some time (when learning something new). He makes a few interesting points about how to learn in several videos. Great Masterclass!
