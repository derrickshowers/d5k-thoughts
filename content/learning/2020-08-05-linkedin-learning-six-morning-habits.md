Something different today. LinkedIn Learning “course” (defined as a podcast) about things you should do every morning. Acronym the author uses is SAVERS.

1. Silence (Meditation): “Practice silence for greater clarity, stay relaxed but attentive”
    * Don’t try to think (shower thoughts bring best ideas).
    * Meditation is a way to engineer that process into your day.
    * Don’t judge your experience.
    * Find balance of relaxation and attentiveness.
2. Affirmations: “Make truthful affirmations, craft as commitments”
    * Written statement that directs your focus to something of value.
    * Make it truthful, not “I am a millionaire”
    * Don’t use flowery, passive words “I am a money magnet, money flows to be effortlessly and in abundance”
    * Find something deeply meaningful to you and answer why it’s important.
    * When will you get this done?
3. Visualization: “Use visualization to motivate yourself”
    * Visualize the activity, not just the end result.
    * See yourself doing it with a smile on your face.
    * 3rd or 1st person? Either, but 3rd person might be easier.
4. Exercise: “Boost your energy with morning exercise”
    * Even 60 seconds...
    * 7 Minute Workout app/video
5. Reading: “Read a few pages each day”
    * One book away from wanting to improve anything in life.
    * Only 5 pages a day, 150 pages a month, one book a month!
6. Scribing (Journaling): “Clarify your priorities by journaling”
