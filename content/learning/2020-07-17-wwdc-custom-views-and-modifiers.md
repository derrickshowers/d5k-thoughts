Not a lot of useful information in this video other than to introduce the idea of putting custom views into the Xcode library. Itâ€™s a fun watch!

* Since the very beginning, Xcode Previews was built to put your content front and center.
* For example, your views are previewable without doing any extra work, and most views and modifiers are inspectable right out of the box as well.
* In Xcode 12, we are taking a step further by letting you add your SwiftUI **views** and **modifiers** to the Xcode library.
