* During spacewalks
    * Red stripe designates the lead spacewalker
    * American flag worn on spacesuit for launch but then for spacewalk it is removed and astronaut’s home country’s flag replaces it (for Chris, Canada)
* Training for spacewalks
    * Early training in Caribbean (lucky them!)
    * Now done in a huge swimming pool at Johnson Space Center (with replicated parts of the space station underwater)
    * 45 feet deep, olympic pool sized length and width.
    * Astronaut lowered into the water with a crane (suit is too heavy to walk with).
    * Weights used to adjust buoyancy to match space.
    * Full sized robotic arm also in the pool to practice choreography - “Up and left” to operator is different from that of spacewalker.
    * Sunset/sunrise every 46 minutes, simulated in pool. Serves as a way to keep track of time and progress.
    * A lot of training in pool is getting comfortable with suit. How to move around. How to fit through airlocks and keep from getting tangled.
* Global perspective - very different when traveling around the world in 90 minutes. World seems so small from up there?
