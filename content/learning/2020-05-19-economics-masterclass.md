These two video are mainly about the ebb and flow of globalization and how it’s changed over the years. He also talks a lot about the misconceptions with global trade, especially in respect to China, specifically in the second of these two videos. Some of the highlights:

* The single biggest advancement to global trade was standardized shipping containers - before there was a lot of labor involved to move things across the ocean, country, etc. With shipping containers, the same container can be shipped by boat, train, or truck!
* Two groups getting richer: world elite, Chinese/Indian middle class. Everyone else getting poorer (e.g. blue color works in advanced countries).
* Cheap labor as a result of global trade is hard to fix. Take Bangladesh where they make clothes at cheap wages. We could say we’re going to stop buying clothing from there, but that’s their main (only?) export so it would hurt them even more. They’re relatively ok at making clothes (most other countries _can_ make clothes, but why?) and cheap labor is their advantage.
* Not always about you as a country not being able to produce a product, it’s saving the manpower and talent to work on other things (e.g. should engineers be used to design and manufacture aircraft? Or something else?)
* Yes it is true that China opening up trade (1989) to the world displaced jobs requiring lower education, and is likely a contributor in the rising inequality, but so do other things. Technology!
* Trade is talked about differently (e.g. “we should go back to not trading with China”) than something like technology (e.g. we don’t often say “we should get rid of technology”). Trade gets tied up with nationalism.

**China**

* Tariffs on things like steel hurts other industries. For example, cars are more expensive to make.
    * Jobs are built over years around global environment, disrupting it (by raising tariffs for instance) creates shock and therefore loss of jobs (which is what it’s trying to prevent in the first place).
* Trade deficits - we buy a lot more than we sell
    * Not about winning and losing - overall balance of payments - every sale is also a purchase.
    * China is the assembler, all the parts come from other countries, making it a statistical illusion.
* Real trade problems with China are around intellectual property - finding people to know how to do something, not paying for them, copying.
* Chinese aren’t to blame for domestic issues. Government can be corrupt, disrespectful, and generally not good, but not really the issue with inequality here in America.
