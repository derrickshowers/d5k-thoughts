* To cook or not to cook?
    * Tomatoes/carrots release more antioxidants when cooking, but vitamin C and other vitamins are destroyed.
    * Eat a variety of cooked and raw.
    * Better raw: broccoli, watercress, garlic, onions, red pepper
    * Better cooked: carrots, spinach, cabbage, tomatoes, asparagus
* Green tops of carrots are edible and add a peppery tang (use as you would a herb).
* Skins on vegetables have a bunch of nutrients, scrub instead of peeling (even carrots!).
* Mushrooms left in the sun generate vitamin D, especially after chopping.
* Steaming
    * Healthy because nutrients do not leach onto water (like with boiling)
    * Slightly longer cooking time than boiling.
