* Heat Transfer (3 ways)
    1. Conduction
        * Stovetop, direct heat.
        * Slow transfer of heat, but good for cooking outside more than inside (think meats with charred outside, juicy inside).
    2. Convection
        * Equalized heat distribution through gases or liquids.
        * Example is boiling potatoes (although conduction occurs once heat reached potato's skin).
        * Convection ovens use air to evenly heat food.
        * Probably also Sous-vide?
    3. Radiation
        * Two different types: infrared and microwave.
        * Oven is infrared. Interestingly, glass allows better transfer of infrared heat, so glass baking dishes should be lowered 25 degrees.
        * Microwave shorter waves that get deeper into food, good for foods with lots of moisture, but also removes moisture.
* Browning
    * Two types, caramelization and maillard reduction.
    * Caramelization is specifically for sugars. First sugar turns into a syrup, then eventually brown.
    * Onions are caramelized because of starches in them.
    * 338째 is when sugar starts browning.
    * Maillard reduction is browning process for foods not primarily sugar or starch. Chemical biproduct is produced which changes flavor and aroma. Think roasted meats, coffee, chocolate, dark beer.
    * Cannot brown meats in water/liquid because water never rises about 212째 (except under pressure!) which is why meats are browned before adding liquids
* Coagulation is how egg whites turn into solids
    * Proteins are naturally shaped like coils, but when they denature through applying salt, heat, acide, they unwind, start to attract each other, and lose ability to hold water.
    * Denaturing is reversible. Reason why meats need to rest, so that water (juices) is reabsorbed.
* Fats
    * Fat liquid at room temperature is oil
    * Fats carry flavors that are soluble only in fats
    * Fats can be heated to high temps. Smoke point is how hot the fat can get. Vegetable oil smoke point is 450째 and animal oil is 375째.
* Emulsion
    * 2 substances that normally don't mix dispersed as small droplets into another (oil and water)
    * Oil and vinegar, oil is the "dispersed" liquid, and vinegar is the "continuous". We taste the continuous more.
    * Just mixing oil and vinegar will only work temporarily, need an emulsifier to hold droplets in place. Egg yolks and mustard are most common.
