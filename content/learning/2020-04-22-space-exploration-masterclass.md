* Traveling to Mars is like a current day crossing the ocean - we _can_ do it but it’s very risky.
* We need to decide... Is it worth the risk? What do we gain?
* Using current technology
    * All of our engines are chemical reactions that just push a little habitat (capsule)
    * New kind of engine to accelerate until we’re halfway, then flip around to decelerate? We’d get there a lot faster!
    * Fundamental rocket design hasn’t really changed since we started traveling to space.
* Could we use gravity to get there? This is what we do for probes that travel into deep space, relying on gravitational pull from planets.
* Minimum trip is 6 months, if all things are lined up correctly.
* Lots of advanced navigation is required to time everything correctly.
* Ideas for how to land
    * Airbags deploy and surround the ship, bounces on the surface like a beach ball (works for a rover, but not a heavy object like humans and habitat).
    * Curiosity rover did some combination of a sky crane and rocket to land safely (it was heavier than prior rovers)
    * How we land is still being figured out...
