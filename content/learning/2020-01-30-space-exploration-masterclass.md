* 5 things are needed for a rocket to work:
    1. Fuel
    2. Oxygen (on an airplane, this is pulled from the air, but cannot do that when traveling above the air)
    3. Something to carry (capsule or shuttle)
    4. Something to steer in the air (rudder looking thing at the bottom of the rocket)
    5. Something to steer in space (thrusters on gimbal to move around)
* Separation is necessary because it's very different getting into space than it is flying in orbit. In orbit, you want to be as lightweight as possible.
* Saturn V was the original, separated into sections vertically.
* Shuttle Program introduced a reusable part - the shuttle. 
    * White rockets contain solid fuel separate first, come back down to the surface and are retrieved in the ocean where they land. 
    * Orange fuel tank is next to go, but burns up in the atmosphere and is not reused.
* Modern rockets like those from SpaceX have found a way to save enough fuel on takeoff to return back to the surface to be reused (without having to retrieve it from the ocean).
