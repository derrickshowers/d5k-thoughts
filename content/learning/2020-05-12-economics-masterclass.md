* Health Care: The problem
    * Prices of healthcare in the US are more expensive than anywhere else.
    * OECD [chart](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm) shows how much we spend on healthcare compared to other countries (it’s much higher!)
    * Life expectancy can also be extracted from same site, shows the US lower than most wealthy countries. So what are we gaining?
    * The main issue is that no one is regulating how much money gets spent.
        * Doctors can recommend something based on private interests (called Asymmetric Information)
        * Lots of money spent on administration because insurance companies are able to pick and choose who they want to cover based on risk.
    * Interestingly, Medicare and Medicaid are very expensive (because of who they cover), so providing a system that covers everyone is not much more expensive. Most people who aren’t covered are young and healthy.
* Health Care: The solutions
    * 3 solutions that other countries use (from least expensive to most expensive)
        1. Socialized medicine (UK - NHS)
        2. Single payer system, government runs insurance (Canada)
        3. More regulations on private insurance (Germany, Switzerland, and maybe Obamacare)
    * Solutions for health care reform are not hard financially, hard politically
        * Not as expensive as people think.
        * Large insurance companies and drug companies don’t want it for obvious reasons.
        * Many people: “don’t fix it if it ain’t broke”
    * A system like this with a lot of history is hard to change!
