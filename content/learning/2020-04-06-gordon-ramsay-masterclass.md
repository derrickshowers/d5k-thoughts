**Szechuan Roasted Whole Chicken**

* Season inside cavity, juices come out more flavorful.
* Stuff cavity so chicken holds its shape (easier to carve breast).
* Egg yolk helps seasoning stick to skin (also turns chicken brown).
* Add szechuan pepper
* Use tray for air to get under.
* 400¬∫ for 60 minutes (or until leg joint reaches 165¬∫).
* Let rest before carving so juices don‚Äôt escape (at least 10 mins).
* End of the video is all about how to carve the chicken.
* I like his presentation! üëç

**Szechuan Chicken Breast and Udon Noodles**

* Continuation, ideas of what to do with roasted chicken.
* Chicken stock and resting juices, reduced.
    * Try adding lemongrass, ginger, cilantro, garlic
    * Instead of salt, use soy
    * Make broth, leave all ingredients in, chill, and then bring up to boil days later.
* Sautee shiitake mushrooms, bok choy, sugar snap peas, scallions (in order).
    * Tiny touch of butter with mushrooms
    * Don‚Äôt overuse sesame oil. Tiny tiny bit or becomes over pungent.
* Back to broth, strain ingredients. Add a bit of cilantro (pick from stalk) - gives nice fragrance. Add some sesame oil.
* Udon noodles, blanched and run through seasoned olive oil.
* Presentation (beautiful! üòç)
    * Roll udon noodles around craving knife and cut after rolling so they‚Äôre all the same size. Place rolled noodles in the center of plate.
    * Vegetables on top of udon noodles.
    * Sliced chicken next.
    * Lemon salt.
    * Pour over broth.
    * Garnish with sliced scallions (thinly sliced like spaghetti) sat in ice water.
