* Navigating without instruments: Soyuz (Russian spaceship)
    * Soyuz (Russian spaceship) best simple example.
    * Had a periscope to look straight out, align with the horizon.
    * Use the Earth as your guide if you can!
* Navigating with instruments
    * Magnetic field
    * Star sensors are used to determine location by comparing angle of two stars. Stars are the only thing in the sky with a fixed position (relatively).
    * Accelerometers (to figure out how speed and velocity)
    * Gyroscopes (once initial position is established)
    * ISS uses position of GPS satellites around it
* State vector
    * Used instead of position since you are traveling so fast, one small change to direction means big change to position.
    * Where are you and where are you going?
* Navigating to ISS
    * Co-orbit to stabilize (will continue to be the same distance apart forever)
    * Rendezvous by dropping to lower orbit
    * Gently increase orbit
    * Originally took 50 hours to launch, rendezvous, and dock to space station
