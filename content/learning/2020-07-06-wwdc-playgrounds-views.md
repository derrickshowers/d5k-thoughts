Nice overview of using Playgrounds on iPad. Also a nice overview of creating a simple SwiftUI view.

* When starting a new project, choose “Xcode Playground” (vs a Playground book). Woah, mind blown, didn’t know this existed. Although I’m not entirely sure what the _actual_ difference between the two are.
* Move curly brace around existing code by dragging it down.
* Locations button on top left to get playgrounds saved in other places.
* Color picker in autocomplete bar to find a `UIColor`.
* Move code to new file under Shared Sources, like moving to a new target.
* Lots of keyboard shortcuts highlighted in this session!
