Mainly about the geography in the United States and how it has changed economics in different ways depending upon red vs blue states, cities vs industrial towns. Skilled labor is becoming more and more popular economically, so metropolitan areas are formed around people. However, some cities make it hard for people to move there because of restriction on construction (SF for instance making it a “low rise city” but then it’s only affordable for rich people). the blue state problem is, while there are thriving economies, much of the population is priced out. Red state problem is that cities are too sprawling and make it hard for people to get to jobs. Small industrial towns are still hanging on to manufacturing industries that simply don’t exist anymore (e.g. Utica, NY wanting manufacturing to come back once based on the Erie Canal).
