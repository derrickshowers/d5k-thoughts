* Good overview in the beginning, second part goes over simple app example using combine in a single view controller.
* Real world example
    * Publisher is a radio tower
    * Subscriber is the radio
    * Hammer is the operator (describes the behavior for changing values, transformer)
* Relationship between publisher and subscriber
    * Input (subscriber) must match output (publisher)
* Special Subscribers
    * `sink`
    * `assign`
* `PassThroughSubject` used to quickly create publisher
* Nice simple example in playgrounds ~9mins
* Remainder of the video is implementation in a single view controller
