Read a few pages on sausage (pages 508-515).

* Many sausage is less prone to overcooking than other meats (steak). True to an extent because of the brining, but not entirely.
* Cooking inside
    1. Place sausages in cold water (or kraut) and allow water to simmer.
    2. Let sausages poach until 140ยบ
    3. Brown in skillet (interior temp will rise to 160ยบ)
* Grill
    * Cook on cooler side (no burners) until 140ยบ, then brown on hot side.
    * Or, better yet, put in aluminum foil pan with kraut until 140ยบ
