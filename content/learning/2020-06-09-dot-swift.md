Extremely high level covering generally how sign in with Apple works. It works mainly the same as the [OIDC protocol](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oidc). Apple recommends placing the ‚Äúsign in with apple button‚Äù above the other sign in buttons üòé. Key is obtained on the developer portal.

Some more reference on how this works [from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/implementing_user_authentication_with_sign_in_with_apple).
