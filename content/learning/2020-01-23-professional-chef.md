* 3 types of contaminants: chemical (cleaning supplies), physical (plastic), biological (primary)
* Biological include:
    * Fungi – spoilage
    * Viruses – Spread by not washing hands (ex. Hepatitis A)
    * Parasites
    * Bacteria – most common; needs protein source, moisture, and time
* Bacteria lives on the surface and is why only the surface needs to be cooked to a certain temp (165°F for 15 secs)
* Cooling foods safely requires getting them as below 41°F as quickly as possible (for hot liquids put metal container in ice bath and stir)
* Basic idea is to keep out of the danger zone as much as possible
