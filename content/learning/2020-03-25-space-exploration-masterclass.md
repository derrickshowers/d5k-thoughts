Introduction to the International Space Station! Couple of videos on the ISS, first is the intro - conception, design, construction.

* Laboratory in space. Able to test taking away a major component that exists on Earth, gravity. What are the effects on the body? Flames? How heat transfer works? It's also an observatory for space as well as our own planet from a different vantage point.
* Prior to the ISS
    * Soyuz (Russian)
    * Skylab (NASA)
* In 1986, Mir (means "the world" and "peace").
* Then, ISS
    * 15 nations
    * First time it wasn't about who was first, collaboration between nations who were at conflict on Earth.
* Design
    * Laboratories and living space inside modules sent up separately.
    * NASA pieces sent up in shuttle's cargo hold, defining their shape.
    * Russian pieces size and shape determined by rail car (circumference from tunnels, length from turns by train)
    * 8 solar arrays, twist and spin to follow sun
    * Radiators radiate heat (no conduction or convection in space), turn so they can point away from the sun
* Constructed via robot arms on shuttle and on space station itself.
* Private companies will now be building their own laboratories in space.
