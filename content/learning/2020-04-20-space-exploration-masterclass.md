Lots of common sense in this video, but parts are interesting nonetheless. Main point of the video is that simulators are very important to be able to prepare for what happens on a mission, but also can be wrong, so trust your instinct, too!

Some other interesting tidbits:

* Simulation training occurs across agencies (Russians, Amercans, Chinese).
* After training in Houston, American astronauts go to Russian simulator where there is a replication of the space station in a vacuum! Simulation can “pop a leak” and you can _feel_ the pressure drop.
* Future simulations can be simulated using VR. For instance, working while spacewalking is simulated really well using VR (weight of materials simulated with strings attached to VR gloves(.
