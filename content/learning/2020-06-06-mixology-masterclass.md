* Explore your palette and get to understand your biases, then play with that (maybe you learn that you tend to prefer things sweeter)
* The Lemonade Test
    * Age of lemon juice is a factor, always taste before using to see if it’s what you expect.
    * Both of them use this for everyone new who starts at their bars - establishes a base for your palette. Simple three ingredients (lemon juice, water, sugar), but identifies if you prefer sweet or sour.
    * Lynnette’s lemonade: 1 part lemon juice, 1 part 1:1 sugar water, water and ice.
    * Mr Lyan’s lemonade: 1 part lemon juice, 1 part 2:1 sugar water, sparkling water and ice.
    * After a base, play around with the flavors to explore: use honey instead of simple syrup, use fruits like blackberries to sweeten it, add a touch of salt to cut the bitterness, or garnish with mint.
