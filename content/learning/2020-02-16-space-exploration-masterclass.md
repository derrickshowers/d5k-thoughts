* The feels of launching into space
    * Can take many, many years until finally entering space. For Chris, it was more than 25 years, so very excited for it to actually happen.
    * Transport to launchpad (in the "Astro Van") is ~3 miles (viewing area is 5 miles).
    * Once in the ship, all the checks are done, but computer manages most of the startup process (lighting engines when necessary, for example). Counting down hoping launch will happen.
    * At 10 seconds, 3 of the engines are lit (by the computer) to make sure they're working, but not enough power to lift the vehicle off the ground.
    * At 3 seconds, all engines are lit and launch is underway.
    * As soon as they clear the launch tower, communication is switched to Houston.
    * So much shaking you have to pull onto a bar on the instrument panel so your neck can absorb the vibrations.
    * During launch, constantly thinking about where to land in the event of an emergency.
    * So much acceleration makes it hard to do anything, head is 3 times its normal weight, until finally you punch through, engines are detached, and sudden weightlessness and calm (but moving something like 25 times the speed of sound üò±)
    * As soon as you get into space, you realize this is actually happening, but only the beginning of the mission.
* Atmospheric drag
    * Equation for drag is, drag = density (of the air) x velocity¬≤ x surface area
    * Easy to understand example: driving in a car, sticking your hand out the window. The faster you go (velocity) the more drag. If you open your hand you increase surface area, therefore increasing drag.
    * Density of the air in space is 0, so drag is 0 once through the atmosphere.
    * Initial couple minutes of launch is actually the slowest because the density of the air is the most. Velocity is increased as density of the air decreases until finally density is 0.
    * Actual equation is written as `drag = 0.5 x ùúå x V¬≤ x A`.
