Most of the talk was about machine learning, specifically deep learning. Lots of neat examples of what deep learning is able to accomplish in a fraction of the amount of time humans can. Video was a bit dated, but showed some interesting examples of image and voice recognition. The last 5 minutes is probably the most interesting where he uses a couple of simple graphs to talk about the impact of deep learning on our world. He compares it to the next biggest thing in our history, the industrial revolution. But with the industrial revolution, things just kind of flattened out. That will not be the case with deep learning as computers will continue to educate themselves to become more and more powerful, the angle of the curve just keeps increasing. He also talked a bit about the job displacement. In most of the worldâ€™s developed countries, services account for 80% of the workforce, which will be replaced by computers once they are smart enough (or smarter) than us at these tasks (driving, translations, etc.).
