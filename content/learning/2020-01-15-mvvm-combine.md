* Coordinator pattern would work best for navigation, but out of scope for this tutorial. Instead provides a clean factory method (builder) for the view model to use to create a view and return it back to its view for navigation in SwiftUI.
* Makes sense mostly, but still would like a simple example of Combine end to end to better understand all the pieces... ðŸ¤”
