* Basic goal of any cooking: maximize the organoleptic qualities (colors, juiciness, tenderness, flavor) while guaranteeing its safety and shelf life.
* Defined as "the application of heat to a food product that is vacuum-sealed in a virtually-impervious-to-air plastic bag and cooked for a relatively long period of time at a precise low temperature"
* Similar to slow cooking, except:
    * Slow cooking causes oxidation, which degrades food.
    * Evaporation occurs with slow cooking.
    * Plastic bag eliminates oxidation and prevents moisture from evaporating.
* Juiciness from gentle cooking cycle, gentle cooling phase, pressure from vacuum.
* Pressure of vacuum also encourages food to absorb any aromatics that may be included.
* Benefits of sous vide: juiciness, increased yield (no moisture or fat loss), consistency (all one level of doneness), enhanced flavor and nutrition (flavors not lost to cooking liquid), uniform shape, texture modification (from compression), safety, green merits (reduced energy).
