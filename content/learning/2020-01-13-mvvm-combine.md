* Overview on MVVM
    * MVC is confusing because it's circular (view talks to controller, which talks to model and then back where model talks to controller which talks to view ðŸ˜©)
    * With MVVM:
        * View -> ViewModel (not vice-versa)
        * ViewModel -> Model (not vice-versa)
        * View has no ref to the model
    * Advantages to MVVM: testing and views without a ton of business logic (that all goes in ViewModel)
    * Delegation can be used to communicate back to view, but you lose declarative approach.
* Data layer mostly makes sense, creating a data task that returns a publisher using `Decodable` to map server data to response object
* Still not ðŸ’¯ clear on what `eraseToAnyPublisher` is doing ðŸ¤”
