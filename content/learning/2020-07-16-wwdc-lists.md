Overview of all the new additions to collection views as far as lists (think UITableView). Thereâ€™s lots of neat improvements including self sizing cells being default and just generally more dynamic and flexible with sizing.

* UITableView-like appearance
* Optimized self sizing
    * `preferredLayoutAttributes:` on cell subclasses if you still need set height/width
* Built on top of compositional layout.
* Return different layout configuration for each section using `NSCollectionLayoutSection`.
* `firstItemInSection` can be set by config so first item is the header (data must be aware because now first item is header)
* Swipe actions are now a feature of the cell (in a list cell)
* Separators - separator layout guide to change where separator is positioned (aligned with text, for instance)
* New accessory types, both for trailing and leading
    * Reorder accessory view automatically sets up collection view to reorder.
    * Outline disclosure to automatically create outline view (using new section snapshot APIs).
