Starting a new Masterclass. This one is taught by Paul Krugman and will provide a basic understanding of economics.

* Economics is about people.
* People may make their own decisions, but looking at a large group of people, they’re often predictable.
* The Invisible Hand concept: “Adam Smith’s notion that each individual’s economic self-interest can contribute to the greater economic good under certain market conditions.”
* Economics makes us better thinkers - yoou must learn to separate what you want to be true from what is _actually_ true.
* 2 fundamental principles:
    1. People take advantage of incentives 
    2. Every sale is also a purchase
* Babysitting co-op story
    * There was a group of people who wanted to babysit for each other so they all had a chance to go out. They needed a way to make sure everyone was doing their fair share, so they issued everyone coupons. You would use these coupons to “pay” for someone to babysit, and receive when you babysat for someone else. Problem was, everyone just wanted to hoard their coupons, creating essentially a recession. The solution? Print more coupons.
