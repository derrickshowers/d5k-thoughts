* Shortcuts app (on watch)
    * Choose which shortcuts to sync to watch.
    * Complications to launch specific shortcuts.
* Recap how you can offer shortcuts
    * `SiriKit` and `NSUserActivity`
* If using `NSUserActivity`, app needs to open on device, will not work on watch because itâ€™s a jarring experience to open an app on a different device.
* Intents is the way to go, but...
    * IntentsUI does not work on watch
    * Best option is to have a watch app if user needs to do something in app
    * If no watch app, run via extension (creating a separate target for watch intent)
    * Final option, remote execution. Slower. Needs to run completely in background (`.continueInApp` cannot be used, need to support background execution).
