* Ordinary/small recession can be solved by just printing more money (like the babysitter co-op example), but large recessions cannot.
* Lowering the interest rate won’t work either because of the zero lower bound. Another term that applies here is liquidity trap.
* [Fred economic data tool](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) is fun!
    * Proves that printing more money doesn’t raise average consumer prices 
    * See this by adding lines for printed money and avg consumer price in 2008 in the US and 2001 in Japan.
* National debt is not a major issue in advanced countries. We still haven’t paid off our debt for WWII, we just grew.
    * Debt after WWII was 100% of GDP.
    * Japan’s debt is 200% GDP, many think interest rates will go way up, but have been thinking that for 15 years.
