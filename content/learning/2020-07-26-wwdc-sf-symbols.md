Not a lot of tactile information on symbols, but a lot of recap and lots of information for how to use for designers.

* Symbols provide consistent experience and work well with default font (San Francisco).
* Some symbols match baseline, some do not - intended to balance San Francisco.
* SF Symbols app (designer can use to paste into Sketch)
* Usage: `UIImage(systemName:)`
* Symbols match text styles for dynamic text sizing.
* All platforms support SF Symbols (new for macOS)
* Additions and refinements
    * 750 new - devices, transportation, game controllers, human related symbols
* Localized automatically (even for RTL)
* Multiple colors (like weather app)
