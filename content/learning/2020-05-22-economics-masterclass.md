Last four videos of this course were mainly around how to read and write the facts and not go down the road of bias. Lots of interesting tips.

* Recommended publications: New York Times, Washington Post, Bloomberg, Vox, (Paul also uses Twitter to post, not ingest)
* When reading, leave aside “forcefulness” of the article, is there an actual argument? Or is it just assertions?
* Look at argument for actual causal effect and not just correlated to existing agenda. For example, if you are politically motivated by tax cuts improving the economy, you could make the argument people are moving to southern states because of their lower tax rates, which may be true, but also people have moved to warmer states after the advent of air conditioning.
* “According to so and so” when you say something like “GDP increased” is a red flag - these are facts that can be looked up.
* Don’t trust writers who never admit to being wrong. Good economists admit their mistakes.
* Learn from other countries, use the world for observation. Even if all you care about is the US, it’s still to your benefit to look at other economies and bring back ideas to your own.
* Easy to find data nowadays, look at FRED (“Do you even fred, bro?”)
* Closing remarks:
    * Stay aware. Read, listen.
    * When something puzzles you, “let me try to figure this out”... “let me make sense of this”
    * Think like an economist! Use data!
