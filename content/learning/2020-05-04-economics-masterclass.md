* Adam Smith “The Wealth of Nations” (1776)
    * Argued the value of nations is not the gold or silver they possessed, but the ability to produce goods and services with cooperation and division of labor.
    * Wealth is not about what you have in your pocket, it’s what you can _do_. Interesting. 🤔
* John Maynard Keynes “General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money” (1936)
    * Thought up to this point was that supply creates its own demand (“if you build it they will come”), but Keynes explained how this is not always the case, like in the great depression where there just wasn’t enough demand for current supply.
* Babysitting co-op (from previous video) illustrates this again, there wasn’t demand when supply increased, it was a technical problem (not having enough coupons).
* Government is normally able to fix these issues by doing things like printing more money or increasing government spending.
