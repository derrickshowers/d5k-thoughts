Read a few pages on fish (pages 66-73).

* Parts of a fish
    * Head - good for stocks and stews
    * Eyes - Edible and prized in some cuisines
    * Gills - bitter, best removed
    * Filets - either side of the fishâ€™s body, removing the spine (most meat)
    * Steaks - Cut through vertebrae and stomach cavity (large round fish)
    * Scales - inedible removed with gentle scraping
    * Tail filet - muscle is darker (endurance muscle like red meat), more richly flavored
* Types of fish (and their flavor profiles)
    * Salmon - fatty fish, works well with variety of cooking methods
    * Mackerel - creamy, slightly salty
    * Tuna - Dense, flavorful meat
    * Trout - closely related to salmon, earthy flavor (and flaky)
    * Cod - low fat white fish, cook gently (cook with fats to add succulence)
    * Haddock - similar to cod, cook gently, poach or bake
    * Monkfish - meaty white fish, only eat the tail, pan fry
    * Sea bass - slightly sweet and flaky flesh, thick coat of scales
* Farmed salmon are given astaxanthin in food to make their flesh more pink-orange, only for show because consumers often attribute this to freshness.
* Fish are one of the last major foods mostly caught from the wild
* Removing heads from shrimp is a way to preserve, so head-on shrimp should only be purchased when very fresh.
