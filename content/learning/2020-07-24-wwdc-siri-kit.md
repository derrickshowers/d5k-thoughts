So much exciting stuff I didn’t know about from the keynote!

* SiriKit
    * Disambiguation - follow up questions
        * New API to customize how list is displayed (subtitles and images)
    * Intents UI - how your app shows up in Siri
        * Compact UI - show what’s important
        * Vertical height should be considered
        * Consistent background material (color, material, vibrancy) - keep views transparent
* Shortcuts
    * Folders for shortcuts!
    * Apple Watch has a shortcuts app!
    * Complications can be a shortcut.
    * Cool automation idea - when journal app is opened -> DND, Streaks app, playlist.
    * New triggers - receive email or message, close an app, battery level, connect to charger.
    * Automatic running for time of day!
    * Automation suggestions to gallery.
    * Mindfulness, journaling, music - app can be featured in the wind down experience (`INShortcutAvailabilityOptions`)
