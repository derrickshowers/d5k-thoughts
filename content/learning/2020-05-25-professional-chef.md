* Roux is the opposite of a slurry, but both achieve the same outcome. Slurry is made with a pure starch like cornstarch and mixed into cold water. Roux is the idea of combining fat (clarified butter, butter, oil) and flour over heat.
* Roux is french for “browned butter”
* Cool liquids are mixed into a hot roux, while cool slurry is mixed into a hot liquid.
* Roux gives flavor while slurry doesn’t. The darker the roux, the nuttier the flavor.
* All-purpose flour is best because of its starch content.
* 60 percent flour to 50 percent fat (by weight).
* Full thickening action becomes evident at 200ºF
* Roux creates a more stable sauce (compared to slurry) because starches don’t break down as easily.
