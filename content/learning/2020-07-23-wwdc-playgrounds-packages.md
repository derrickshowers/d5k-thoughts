Session is specific to Playgrounds in Xcode (not standalone macOS, iOS app). Pretty interesting, nonetheless. I love the idea of being able to include a Playground with your package for documentation and tutorials!

The second half of the video was interesting. He demo‚Äôd CoreML and vision framework to identify fruit all within Playgrounds. This might also work on iOS and macOS app? ü§î

* Playgrounds work in packages making a great way to demo and document
* Frameworks and packages can be used in Playgrounds as long as they‚Äôre in the same workspace (use ‚Äúbuild active scheme‚Äù in playground)
* Build logs for Playgrounds available under build tab.
* Access to images from asset catalog (drag into playground)
