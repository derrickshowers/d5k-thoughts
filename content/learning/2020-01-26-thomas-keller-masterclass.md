* Early sous vide example was slow cooking chicken in milk.
* Now we compress food in plastic for modern day sous vide.
    * Compression helps to draw aromas and flavors into the meat.
    * Plastic stops moisture entering or leaving.
    * Cook evenly by eliminating air pockets.
* For salmon:
    * Salt. Add lemon zest? Or even herbs?
    * Compress salmon in plastic wrap. Tie ends.
    * Poke tiny holes to get rid of air.
    * Get water to 144Â°F (use ice), 17-18 minutes (6oz)
    * Flash in oven if not hot enough.
    * Finish with lemon and finishing salt.
