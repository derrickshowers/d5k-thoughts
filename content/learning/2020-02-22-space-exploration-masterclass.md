* Launch Site Logic
    * Standing on the equator, you're moving at 1000 miles per hour. At the poles, 0 miles per hour.
    * Launch sites are placed as close to the equator as possible (Cape Canaveral/Kazakhstan) and spaceship launched to the east to get the free speed boost.
    * Mobile launch sites placed closer to equator on barges for efficiency.
* Orbital Mechanics
    * Visualize orbit as a ball on a string. The longer the string, the faster you have to swing the ball. When the string is short, less energy.
    * Counter intuitive in space because if you speed up, you change to a higher orbit, and essentially slow down (compared to objects in lower orbit). To pass an object, you need to slow down to a lower orbit first.
    * Astronauts trained on racetrack with certain speed restrictions depending upon how near to the center/edge you are.
* Hohmann Transfer
    * Named after Walter Hohmann who theorized a way to change orbits by watching science fiction - basically you fire engines to first put yourself in an oval shaped orbit, and then again at the other side to round the orbit finishing in a higher orbit.
    * Space station needs to do this periodically because there is a very small amount of oxygen in the orbit it follows (because it's relatively low).
* Orbital Mechanics vs Escape Mechanics
    * At some point, speed is increased enough to leave orbit. About 41% of orbital speed to escape.
* Perceived Weightlessness
    * Visualize as running on a diving board. If you can run 5 miles per second, the curvature of the earth would mean you'd never fall into the pool. This is why weightlessness is felt when in space (constantly falling to earth!)
* Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
    * Defined as: Mass(Obj 1) x Mass(Obj 2) / (Distance between to the objects)Â²
    * Visualize by thinking about 2 ice skaters holding hands spinning in a circle. Central point is where they're holding hands.
    * Moon and earth good example of this. They both rotate around an imaginary center, earth is pulled slightly by the moon.
* Fuel and Propulsion
    * Tanks contain fuel + oxidizer (agent required by fuel to burn, oxygen is the most common)
        * Solid fuel
            * Most reliable. Everything in tank burns, no way to throttle or stop it. Like a firework!
            * On space shuttle, two white tanks on the side are solid. They burn until they're done.
        * Liquid fuel
            * Not quite as reliable, but allows throttling. 
            * Second stage rocket and shuttle use liquid fuel to control speed, etc.
    * Ion thruster
        * Small amount of fuel needed. Creates thrust by charging particles.
        * Limited not by mass (fuel) but by energy (electricity). Solar typically used as source of electricity.
        * Not nearly as powerful as fuel (yet!). Good for long range missions without humans, no rush to get anywhere (deep space missions).
    * To get to another planet, equation is something like: Delta Velocity = Velocity x Mass (some fancy equation to determine mass with full tank being used over time).
    * Using this equation for Mars: Spaceship would need to be the following percentages of fuel: solid fuel 93%, liquid fuel 77%, ion 20%. So if we use solid fuel, only 7% of the spaceship would be for other things. Ion is by far the best, but would take way too long with current limitations. Maybe a mix of these?
