* Great depression happened because of a series of _bank run_s.
    * Bank run - everyone pulls money out of the bank because there is fear there won’t be any money left, bank fails.
* Post great depression, federal government insures all deposits, but added regulations to banks to prevent bank runs.
* Shadow banking started as a result. Shadow banking is banks which get around the regulations by doing things like loaning money to more people (who aren’t necessarily qualified).
* Bubbles
    * People are buying something because others are, increasing the value of something to way more than it should be (or creating value out of nothing).
    * Ponzi schemes are an example.
* Irving Fisher responsible for a concept called _debt deflation_.
