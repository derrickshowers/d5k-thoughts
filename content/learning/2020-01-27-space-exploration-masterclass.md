* Discussion around what astronauts need to know to be able to go to space, beyond obvious things like good health.
* To travel to space you need to know how to do everything, and make decisions within 1 breath - tons of learning and very daunting!
* Astronauts are trained to land in all kinds of environments, from oceans to the arctic and deserts.
* Leadership training where each day a different type of leadership is trialed (dictatorship one day, everyone gets a say another day) - preparation for spending time in space together.
