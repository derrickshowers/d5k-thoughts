* Things we need to figure out:
    1. Growing food. We need a sustainable process (instead of just bringing everything along like we do now), but also might help convert CO₂
    2. Learning to live without gravity. 38% of Earth’s gravity. Still, big adjustment after spending time in space with 0 gravity - need time to adjust when we land.
    3. Electromagnetic field on earth protects us from radiation, but doesn’t exist on Mars. How do we protect ourselves from radiation?
    4. 22 minutes for communication to make it each way (if traveling at the speed of light). We’ll need to adapt a different approach to communication, maybe sending video packages back and forth instead of relying on 2-way “realtime” conversations.
* In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU)
    * General idea is using what we can on Mars instead of shipping everything.
    * What do we need to live?
        * O Oxygen to breathe
        * H Hydrogen for fuel
        * H₂O Water for life
    * We know water exists on Mars (H₂O). We can use a process called electrolysis to separate oxygen and hydrogen by introducing a positive and negative charge into the water. We can get electricity using solar energy.
    * We can also use CO₂ to separate into water (H₂O) and methane (CH₄)
    * Using the idea of ISRU, all we need to sustain life is solar panels, equipment to convert solar energy into electricity, and scientific know how!
* All astronauts need to be geologists so they know what to look for on Mars.
* Big objective is determining if life has existed on Mars. To do that, we need to find life itself or fossils buried in rock. You won’t know what to look for if you don’t have the geology education.
