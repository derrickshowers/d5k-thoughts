**Life Support Systems**

* Oxygen
    * Machinery is used (versus trying to grow and use trees) to extract carbon dioxide, releasing the carbon and recirculating the oxygen.
    * Not perfect, so oxygen still need to be sent up with ships (this will not be possible when we go to Mars, so will have to figure out how to make systems more efficient).
* Water
    * Recycled by collecting humidity, urine, and waste water from experiments.
    * Purification system to use this water for food, to drink, etc. - sounds gross but really the same thing that happens on earth, just more personal (smaller loop).
* Food
    * Most of the food is prepackaged by chefs around the world and shipped to the ISS.
    * Growing food is becoming more common (need for Mars!) - starting watercress, tomatoes
    * How to you grow food without gravity? What direction do plants grow? How do you inject nutrients? All this is be experimented both in space and on the ground.

**Experiments**

* AMS (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer)
    * Collects subatomic particles to figure out essence of matter itself.
    * Ground facility straddles the border of France and Switzerland.
    * We can only account for 6% of whatâ€™s out there, rest is dark matter and dark energy (basically _darkness_ in our knowledge).
    
**Commanding the ISS**

In this video Chris talks about leadership fundamentals needed to command the ISS (he was in command for about 6 months).
