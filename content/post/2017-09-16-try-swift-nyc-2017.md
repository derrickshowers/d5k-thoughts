If nothing else, some great people to follow on Twitter!

### Flexible View Controllers with Swift 4
[@jamesdempsey](https://www.twitter.com/jamesdempsey)

* Lie to the compilier for DRY code
* With Swift 4 you can cast something as multiple classes

### Map and Flatmap Magic

### View-State Driven Applications
[@cocoawithlove](https://www.twitter.com/cocoawithlove)

* Presentation driven approach means every view controller has to know about everything about the app.
* Models for everything. Here is all of the view state:
* View state of the app changes based on mutating view state model – response to the view state update.

### Core Data Migrations. Can we do better?
[@rajagp](https://www.twitter.com/rajagp)

* Lightweight migrations for simple things like renaming a property.
* Custom migrations for things like changing data type (e.g. Date -> String)
* NoSQL solved migration issues that Core Data suffers from, but not "one size fits all"
    * Ownous is on the application side to deal with deprecated/modified data
    * Couchbase Lite

### Improving Swift Tools with libSyntax
[@harlanhaskins](https://www.twitter.com/harlanhaskins)

* Syntax tree doesn't keep everything else – comments, braces, spaces, etc.
* libSyntax keeps all of that point ☝️

A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To This Array
[@ericasadun](https://www.twitter.com/ericasadun)

* Talk was about unique ways of creating multiple elements of an array.
* Many good examples in slides.
* Swift is very flexible by combining features of the language.

### MVVM At Scale
[@nataliya_bg](https://www.twitter.com/nataliya_bg)

* Motivation is making view controllers less complex.
* Move business logic out of VC.
* Code structure shouldn't indicate what design pattern you are using.
* View models injected by other view models.

### Creating Rich Custom UI Notifications
[@thedevme](https://www.twitter.com/thedevme)

* Betty White is awesome, Uber sucks.
* We should add a thread id to templates.

### Putting the "Engineering" in "Engineering Management"

### Swift Chatbots for Fun! And Profit?
[@rmundo](https://www.twitter.com/rmundo)

* Chatbots aren't at the point they can have intelligent conversations, but can be used for 1 or 2 functions (like translations).
* Natural language processing is still 2-3 years away.

### Tanner Nelson: Swift on the Server with Viper
[@tanner0101](https://www.twitter.com/tanner0101)

* Why server side Swift?

### Modern RxSwift Architecture
[@KrunoslavZaher](https://www.twitter.com/KrunoslavZaher)

### Exploring Natural Exploring Processing
[@PaolaNotPaola](https://www.twitter.com/PaolaNotPaola)

* NSLinguisticTagger
* Updates automatically with keyboards

### Codable in Swift 4
[@inamiy](https://www.twitter.com/inamiy)

### Machine Ethics and Engineering Technologies
[@pjf](https://www.twitter.com/pjf)

* How many people have to be inconvenienced for an autonomous car to kill someone? Answer is 8 million people – 1 in 8 million die in car accidents. 
* 40,000 fatalities a year with cars – 40,000 different people responsible.
* In the future, maybe 2,000 people will die, but one company responsible – companies may not want to take that risk.
* 3.5 million truck drivers out of a job.
* 8.7 million jobs when including truck driver related industries – hotels, truck stops, etc.
* How do we handle technology replacing jobs? Education.
* 1830 average work week was 70 hours, today... 40 hours.
* Humans should be involved at some point. Example of military drones. But, they are able to be jammed while waiting for approval.

### Getting Started With ARKit

### Building a Franework With Viper
[@Sdhingra89](https://www.twitter.com/Sdhingra89)

* Protocol oriented, testable, single responsibility principle, and reusable.
* More testable than MVVM.

### Error Handling Made Easy
[@elenipapanikolo](https://www.twitter.com/elenipapanikolo) [@krenizask](https://www.twitter.com/krenizask)

### Sodoku in Swift
[@khanlou](https://www.twitter.com/khanlou)

### Better Swift From the Foundation Up
[@carlbrwn](https://www.twitter.com/carlbrwn)

* Compilation of closed issues from a few popular iOS frameworks to figure out where issues originate.
